				<h2>InstaBrand Search</h2>
				<p>
					We created a search engine able to search over 100k influencer across multiple social platforms, where a brand or marketer can search for Influencers who trend on any given topic such as ‚Äúfashion‚Äù or ‚Äúfitness‚Äù. Marketers can drill down into a topic and find related topics within and other influencers related. Marketers are also able to search by geo graphics, followers, engagements, etc. This was a huge big data project, collecting and processing 100‚Äôs of millions of posts, 10‚Äôs of millions of unique hashtags/mentions and billions of relationships all while returning some pretty complex queries in milliseconds üòé.
