				<h2>A little about me</h2>
				<p>
					I’m a Full-stack engineer with startup and agency experience. At 13 years old I created my first e-commerce site and found I had a great passion for the field. 3 years later I started a web development and design company which I held for 7 years, allowing me to gain a lot of self taught development and UX/UI experience. After selling my company I took my experience and started working for large development agencies and brands gaining extensive experience dealing with today’s latest frameworks and languages along with building to scale.  Also helped build a VC funded startup and grew its engineering team to 11 people.

				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p>
					I would like to leverage my backend experience to further my experience in big data and eventually machine learning. I’m looking for a start up environment that has a good balance of allowing engineers to be involved in creative problem solving. Allowing the freedom to improve process, product, culture and not being too confined to a specific procedure but also a startup that does have process in place and is able to make decisive progress.
